Used C programming language to write a new implementation of the Euclidean distance formulation of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). First, read a sparse term-document matrix from a file, with terms (words) on rows and documents on columns. Then applied TF-IDF normalization to the term-document matrix. Randomly initialised factors for NMF. Applied Euclidean NMF to the normalized term-document matrix for a user-specified value of k. Finally report the top terms for each cluster.
